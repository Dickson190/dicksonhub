    <h2>ðŸŒŸ Welcome to Our New Referral System! ðŸŒŸ</h2>
    <p>We're excited to introduce our updated referral system designed to reward you even more for sharing our platform with your friends!</p>
    
    <h3>How It Works:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Earn 100MB per Referral:</strong> For every friend you refer who joins our platform, you'll earn <strong>100MB</strong> added to your referral balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Free Withdrawal at 500MB:</strong> Once you accumulate <strong>500MB</strong> in your referral balance, you can withdraw it <strong>completely free of charge</strong>! This is our way of saying "thank you" for helping us grow.</li>
        <li><strong>Reach the 2GB Limit:</strong> You can keep referring and earning up to <strong>2GB</strong> of referral data. After reaching 500MB, further withdrawals will require a small fee of <strong>â‚¦600</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Reset and Start Again:</strong> After each successful withdrawal, your referral balance and limit reset, so you can start earning all over again! The first 500MB you accumulate in the next cycle will also be free to withdraw.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why a Fee After 500MB?</h3>
    <p>We aim to provide the best experience possible, and the small fee helps us cover the costs of maintaining this referral program while continuing to offer high-quality services. We appreciate your understanding and continued support!</p>

    <h3>Keep Referring, Keep Earning:</h3>
    <p>Whether youâ€™re looking to earn free data or maximize your referral earnings, our new system is designed with your needs in mind. Keep spreading the word and enjoy the benefits!</p>

    <p><strong>Need Help?</strong> If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to our support team. We're here to help!</p>

    <h3>How to Refer:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to the <strong>Refer and Earn</strong> page.</li>
        <li>Get or copy your referral code.</li>
        <li>Tell people about DicksonHub and get them to:
            <ul>
                <li>Sign up.</li>

                <li>Visit the <strong>Refer and Earn</strong> page and input your code.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
