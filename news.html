              <p class="date">Posted on April 28, 2024</p>
              <p>Dear Members, we're experiencing issues in processing BANK withdrawals, resulting in slower payment rates. Rest assured, we're actively working to resolve this issue. Withdrawals may take up to 10 days to process, but this delay is TEMPORARY, and we expect to return to normal fast payment within 10 days. DicksonHub is always safe to use; we've always prioritized timely payments. All pending withdrawals will be processed promptly once the issue is resolved. Thank you.</p>
